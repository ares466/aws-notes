# Mechanical Turk

Amazon `Mechanical Turk` is a managed human-outsourcing service that can be used to perform `Human Intelligence Tasks` (HITs). Using the Mechanical Turk APIs, developers can extend their apps with human workers.

`Workers` earn money by completing HITs. Mechanical Turk is a pay-per-task billing system for tasks that are more suited for humans rather than ML.

Workers can have `qualifications` that demonstrate their expertise to complete a task. Developers can also require that workers complete a test before being assigned HITs.

Mechanical Turk can be used for AI training.
