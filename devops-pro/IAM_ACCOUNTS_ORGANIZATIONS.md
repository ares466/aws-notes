# IAM, Accounts, and Organizations

**IAM identities** consist of IAM users, IAM groups, and IAM roles. 

**IAM policies** can be attached to IAM identities to grant permissions to AWS services.

An IAM policy consists of an optional *SID*, an *action*, an *effect*, a *resource*, and a set of *conditions*.
