# Neptune

Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. 

The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency.

Neptune runs within a VPC so it is private by default.

Neptune is MultiAZ and scales when using read replicas.

You can enable continuous backups to S3 and restore based on a `point-in-time`.
